					<h2 class="h2">Who am I?</h2>
					<p>
						I'm a progammer and mathematician working on a joint
						degree in computer science and mathematics.<br />
						In general I'd rather learn via a project than by
						sitting in class, so I make lots of projects for
						practice and for fun. My favourites are the projects
						that someone will actually use, simple or complex it's
						always satisfying to put my skills to use making
						someones life a bit easier. <br /><br />
						To relax I like to play video games. I mostly play
						strategy games like: Sid Miers Civilisation 6, Xcom2 and
						Chess, but I'm also a huge fan of Warframe. The whole
						game is amazing, from the immersive story telling to the
						buttery smooth movement system, to it's healthy
						monotisation model. Would highly recommend it, one of
						the best free to play games ever made.<br /><br />
						I also enjoy running DnD campaigns. I've been DM-ing for
						6 years now and I'd say I'm getting the hang of it,
						although the character mortality rate remains
						questionably high at my table :].<br />

						<p>It's a little buggy, and I didn't implement promoting pawns in this online interface. The local version in the projects system is more robust.</p>

						<h3 class="h3"><a class="link" href="https://github.com/Temujin142857/Chess_Engine" target="_blank">Chess Engine</a></h3>
						<p>I made a chess board and engine in Java. It's pretty good, I'd say around 1800 elo when I run it on my main computer. The online version in this website
							is hosted on a laptop with 2gb of ram and a barely working cpu, so it's quite a lot weaker than when it's run locally.
							To determine it's move it used a minmax search with Alpha-beta pruning.<sup class="link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaâ€“beta_pruning" target="_blank">1</a></sup>
							<br />
							Just for fun I decided to write the evaluation algorithm myself with my somewhat decent chess knowledge.
							That's probably the main reason it's only 1800 elo, since the weights it uses to determine the strength of a given position
							were decided on vibe.

						<p>This website was made to serve as an introduction to myself, and to showcase some of my projects.
							I'm well known for doing things the hard way and taking on unnecesary challenges, so I thought instead of 
							just linking my projects I'd try to build some of them into the site.<br/>
							The chess engine is the first that I've succeeded on. I made a headless version of the engine and a chess board in vue.js.<br/>
							From there I set up an api which can run the headless app and pass commands from the UI to the engine.

						<p>This is a fun one! It's a website I made for teambuilding in Pokemon Draft Leagues. A Pokemon Draft League is pretty much a tournament
							where at the start everyone drafts a roster of 12 pokemon, and then uses it to make a team of 6 for each round of the tournament.
							I used to use a teambuilder and a damage calculator each in theor own tab when teambuilding for a draft league, and this website is the two combined into one page.
							<br />
							You can find the website here: <a class="link" href="https://draftdex.ca" target="_blank">DraftDex</a>. 
							<br />
							I wrote it in React, so I could use the frontend as a submition for a class project, but I generally prefer Vue.js. 
							It's a very fat client architecture, where everything takes place in the clients browser, even the database calls.
							I know that's generally bad form, but it's not like there's anything sensitive in the database, and I'm running it and this website
							on the same old laptop with 8gb of ram.

						<p>This one is still a work in progress, but it's the one I'm the most proud of already.
							I won't say too much yet but it's going to be good!

							This is an ESOLang (esotaric language) based on the "crazy? I was crazy once" copy pasta.
							It will be what I'm calling the first Rat Orients Programmling language haha.
